# PetAmigo

A pet adoption app inspired by my own canine pal.

## Purpose

I built this application to help connect pets in need with loving homes and make the world a slightly better place.

## Functionality

This application:

- Is an SPA
- Allows users to search for pets based on the type of pet selected and city, state or zipcode input.
- Fetches pet data from the Petfinder api and displays it in pet card components.
- Fetches dog facts from the dogapi and displays one at a time when the page loads.
- Allows a user to sign in using their Google account and submit a pet for adoption on form submission. Pets submitted for adoption are then displayed in pet cards in the site's Featured Pets section.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JavaScript
- React
